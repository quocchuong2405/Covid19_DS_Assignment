# Covid19_DS_Assignment
My Covid-19 prediction project for Discrete Structure course

This submission contains the full report, short report, a folder to contain the source codes, and a folder to contain data sets.

===================================================

+ Detailed weekly task tracking and contribution percentages are listed in both reports.

+ The links to source code files are provided in the full report (Chapter 9 and 10), as well as the links to which we collected the data sets. Viewing the code through these links are highly recommended (no installation required).

+ The .ipynb files included in the .zip can be opened using Visual Studio Code (with extension pre-installed), by Jupyter Notebook, or by importing them into your Google Colab's account and re-run every cell (not recommended).

+ If you have any questions, please contact this email: cnguyenvanquocpro@gmail.com
